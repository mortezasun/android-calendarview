## Migration and Modernization (v2.0.0)

All 8 phases of the 2.0.0 modernization plan are complete:

1. **CI and Test Stability:**
   - Both `Android verification` and `Android instrumentation` workflows run on GitHub Actions with 100% pass rate.
   - Fixed Compose test scroll issues with inner scrollable containers and out-of-viewport touch target handling.
2. **Legacy API Audit & Mapping:**
   - Documented complete 1.x -> 2.0.0 mapping in [docs/V2_MIGRATION_MAPPING.md](V2_MIGRATION_MAPPING.md).
3. **Compose Feature Parity:**
   - Added `fixedSixRows` (42-cell uniform grid) for month transitions.
   - Added `showHeader` and `showWeekdayLabels` visibility controls.
   - Added today focus indicator with primary border highlight.
   - Verified selection states (None, Single, Multiple, Range) with consecutive epoch identities.
4. **Legacy Sample UI Migration:**
   - Removed `CalendarViewActivity`, legacy XML layouts, and dangling activity entries.
   - `LauncherActivity` and `HeatMapViewActivity` are 100% native Compose.
5. **Legacy View and ViewBinding Elimination:**
   - Deleted all legacy custom views (`MultiMonthView`, `MonthView`, `DayHeatMapView`, etc.).
   - Removed `viewBinding = true` and unused legacy dependencies across `:library` and calendar engines.
6. **Artifact Isolation:**
   - Decoupled `ir.huri:jalalicalendar` from `:library`; now strictly encapsulated in `:calendar-solarHijri`.
   - All modules compile and test independently.
7. **Edge Cases & Localization:**
   - Verified locales (`en`, `de`, `fa`, `ar`), RTL layout direction, and activity recreation state preservation.
8. **Documentation and Versioning:**
   - Aligned versions to `2.0.0`.
   - Updated `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `V2_MIGRATION_MAPPING.md`.
